1.Assign value to variable:
x=100 
echo $x
echo $COLUMNS x $LINES

2. Navigating directories:
pwd: print the current (working) directory to the terminal
ls: list the contents of the current directory
cd Downloads: move to the Download directory
cd ~ : move to home directory
cd Desktop/Photos: relative path
VS. cd /home/workspace/Desktop/Photos: absolute path
cd .. : go up one directory (move to the parent directory)
ls .. : list the contents of the parent directory

3. Options with 'ls' command:
ls -l: gives a more detailed list than 'ls' itself
ls *.txt : list all the files whose name END with '.txt'
ls bear* : list all the files whose name START with the word 'bear'
ls *poem* : results in listing 'bad_poem.rtf' and 'nonsense_poem.txt'

4. Organizing directory/files (mkdir, mv):
mkdir Documents/Books: create a folder named 'Books' inside Documents directory
mv Documents/*.epub Documents/Books: move all '.epub' files into Books directory

5. Downloading files (curl):
curl 'https://www.google.com' : output whatever it downloads directly to the terminal.
curl -L -o google.html 'http://google.com' : download content from the page, give it a name 'google.html'  
(-L : redirect option of 'curl')
(-o : output the data to a file)

6. Viewing files (cat, less):
cat Desktop/dictionary.txt : display the full content of the file
less Desktop/dictionary.txt : display the output in a format that allows you to search and scroll
(space/down arrow: scroll down. b/up arrow: scroll up.  /: search.  q: quit)

7. Removing things (rm, rmdir):
rm SillyFile.txt: delete the file PERMANENTLY
rm -i SillyFile.txt: delete the file PERMANENTLY, but double-check first
rm file1 file2 file3: delete multiple files
rmdir BadDirectory: delete the directory PERMANENTLY
rmdir Dir1 Dir2 Dir3: delete multiple directories
NOTE: if file-name or directory-name has a SPACE in it, put the whole name in single quotes
e.g. rm *'Bad F'* : remove files with 'Bad F' phrases in it
