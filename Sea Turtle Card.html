			<p>Sea turtles don't really have a favorite food, though it is commonly believed that 
				they love jellyfish! They have been around for more than 100 million years - even 
				surviving the dinosaurs when they became extinct 65 million years ago. They are 
				considered threatened or endangered. It is estimated that only 1 out of 1000 hatchlings 
				survives to be an adult.
